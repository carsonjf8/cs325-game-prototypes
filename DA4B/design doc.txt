CS 325 - Introduction to Computer Game Design
Digital Assignment 3 - Carson Forsyth
Laser Night
Originality: What is original about your game?
	It is a flying racing game where you must also avoid obstacles and perform simple tricks.
Technical Merit: What is interesting about your game technology?
	I am hoping that the feeling will be good due to the controls and physics and that I am using a 3D library.
Prototype Postmortem: What did you learn from this prototype? What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
	I am learning how to use Three.js to do all the 3D graphics and the graphics pipeline.
Prototype Assets: Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
	The textures are borrowed and credits are in the text file in the folder.
Prototype Closest Other Game: Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
	I am not aware of any other games that resemble the style and type of game I am going for.
High Concept: A one-sentence summary of your game.
	Race against other planes and avoid the obstacles.
Theme: State which of the themes or challenges you used.
	None.
Mandated Variety: State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
	Input: keyboard, indirect
	Randomness: deterministic
	Genre: 3D, third person
	Play Style: Competitor
Prototype Goal: What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
	3D graphics
Player Experience Goals: What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
	A fast paced game that feels good and like you are flying a plane.
Gameplay: A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
	The controls are not all working properly but you can use QE to roll, ARROW UP and DOWN to pitch, ARROW LEFT and RIGHT to yaw.
Play Time: How long does your game take to play?
	Only a few minutes.
